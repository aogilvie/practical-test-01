Practical Test #1

1 ) Using wizSpinner phonegap plugin, implement a custom graphic (custom.gif) to replace the native UIActivityIndicatorView.

2 ) Submit your Pull Request to the master branch when done

custom.gif
![custom](https://github.com/aogilvie/practical-test-01/raw/master/custom.gif)


The Spec;

- custom.gif can be loaded from anywhere (on device or server) - but flexibility is best!
- the gif must be resize-able so add width and height options to the API call from JS for the custom image options
- the gif is not transparent so dont worry it is not important if it looks like hell
- you must use PhoneGap 1.7
- you must use wizSpinner branch 1.7
- you must use latest iOS SDK
- minimum target is iOS 4.3

 
Lastly,
If you dont finish just send us what you have!
Good luck and hf! May the unicorn god of rainbows be with you!
